  The company's history can be traced back to Huff Daland Dusters, founded in 1924 in Macon, Georgia as a crop dusting operation.
  The company moved to Monroe, Louisiana, and was later renamed Delta Air Services, in reference to the nearby Mississippi Delta region,
  and commenced passenger services on June 17, 1929. Among predecessors of today's Delta Air Lines, Western Airlines and Northwest
  Airlines began flying passengers in 1926 and 1927, respectively.</h4>

  and the second-largest in terms of both revenue passenger-kilometers flown (277.6 billion)and capacity (4.4 billion ASM/week; March 2013).</h4>
